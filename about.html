                My name is Rain Babauta and I’m aspiring to be a programmer. I was born and raised on the island of Guam until 2010, when my family moved to California so that my siblings and I could get a better education. In my free time, I like to play video games, program, and spend time with my siblings. I have a passion for philosophy, science, and technology and someday I want to contribute to the advancement of machine learning technology. I’m excited about the infinite possibilities of what AI can do to solve all of the complex problems our society faces today.

            <p id="about-p">
                As a programmer, I got my start in high school with a programming class alongside some online programming courses like Codecademy. I went on to take 2 years of lower level college programming classes but these were not enough so I did my own challenges like 1 programming puzzle per day for a month. More recently, I have been challenging myself to work on my current project for 10 minutes per day, which I have kept up for 16 months at the time of writing this (6/15/2020). My project uses a python library called Neat-Python to evolve digital creatures to be able detect and compete for food with all the other creatures in a 2D world that I’ve created for them.
