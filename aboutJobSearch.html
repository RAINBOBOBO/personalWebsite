              JobSearch is a React app that I worked on while attending Rithm School. It uses a PSQL database and an express backend to access that info. The app has login and sign up capability and uses LocalStorage and JWTs to maintain a logged in state. In addition to logging in, you can view a list of (fake) job postings, search for specific jobs/companies, and view details about each posting.
